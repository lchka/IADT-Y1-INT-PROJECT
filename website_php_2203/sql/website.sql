', 'In total, 907,000 cars were sold in EU markets plus the UK, Norway, Switzerland and Iceland in January, according to figures from industry analyst Jato Dynamics. \r\n\r\nThe growth was driven by the increasing uptake of SUVs, which made up 464,900 of the total number of registrations for a record market share of 51.3%. It’s the first time SUVs have formed more than half of all new car registrations in Europe. “The recent EV boom drew attention away from SUVs, but due to their popularity with consumers around the world, they continue to play an important role in driving the slow recovery of the industry,” said Felipe Munoz, global analyst at Jato Dynamics. \r\n\r\nBut while the overall number of registrations improved year on year, the total figure is still down by around 8% compared with pre-pandemic 2019. \r\n\r\n“We are seeing positive signs, but not enough to take the market back to the position it was in before the pandemic hit. The reality is that we might never see sales at that level again,” Munoz said. \r\n\r\nMuch of last year was heavily impacted by shortages of new vehicles (caused in part by the semiconductor supply crisis) as well as inflation and spiking energy prices – factors intensified by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\r\n\r\nSales of battery-electric cars (BEVs) remained healthy, increasing by 14% year on year to 92,700 units. The Tesla Model Y was January’s best-selling EV with 7174 units sold, followed by the Dacia Spring (4242) and Volkswagen ID 4 (3812). \r\n\r\nHowever, Jato suggested that growth has started to slow, indicating a potential peak in EV sales. “Without affordable options from OEMs or more attractive incentives from governments across Europe, it seems that demand may be close to reaching a peak,” Munoz said. \r\n\r\nThe Dacia Sandero was Europe’s best-selling car in January, led by high demand in France and Italy.

The Dacia Jogger Hybrid uses the E-Tech powertrain previously seen in various Renault models, as well as the Nissan Juke. When the hybrid Mégane, Clio and Captur launched, Renault said that E-Tech had been developed as a fairly low-cost hybrid system with the view to using it to electrify Dacia models.\r\n\r\nAs a refresher, this consists of a naturally aspirated 1.6-litre four-cylinder engine; a clutchless and unsynchronised four-speed gearbox; and two electric motors. The larger of those drives through the ’box, while the smaller one acts as a starter-generator and adjusts the engine’s RPM for rev-matching.\r\n\r\nRELATED DACIA JOGGER REVIEWS\r\nDacia Jogger road test review\r\nDacia Jogger 1.0 TCe 110 Comfort 2022 UK first drive\r\nSince the standard 1.0-litre turbo petrol engine is always coupled to a manual, the Hybrid is also the only Jogger with an automatic option.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe good news on paper is that the Hybrid gets a 28bhp boost over the 1.0 TCe and shaves 1.1sec off the 0-62mph time, although the result is still a hardly breathtaking 10.1sec. The 1.2kWh battery also robs no luggage space. However, it does take the place of the spare wheel.\r\n\r\nThe driving experience is mostly what you would expect from the combination of the Jogger with the E-Tech system. The suspension is soft but well controlled, making it remarkably comfortable, and it’s surprisingly good fun on a twisty road, as the steering weights up intuitively in the corners. No changes there.\r\n\r\nThe powertrain is happiest when you take it easy, as then it can surf on the electric power. Even so, the engine is very rough at idle and when it’s charging the battery. If you then demand a lot of acceleration, you could be waiting a while for that complicated ’box to slot the right ratio, whether up or down. The hybrid may have 28bhp more than the 1.0 TCe, but due to those long gears and slow shifts, it feels only marginally quicker. With a bit of good will, you soon learn to drive around the quirks, but you shouldn’t really have to do that in a modern car.', '17:05:17', '5 mins', 2),

(12, 'Adriana Beckett', '2022-05-13', '/images/70 irish crs.png', '70% of Irish Car Buyers Are Considering An EV', 'Irish Buyer Are Considering EV!', 'DoneDeal, Ireland’s largest car website, in association with the SEAI, has released its latest consumer market insights and found that 70% of Irish consumers are considering an electric vehicle as their next car purchase. (Source: Survey of 1,000 car buyers in November & December 2022).\r\n\r\nOnsite demand for new & used electric vehicles (EVs) grew by 33% in 2022 (DoneDeal proprietary Ad View Data), while demand for diesel fell 39% during the same period. For the first time, 2022 was the first year when an electric vehicle, the Volkswagen ID.4, was the most in-demand new car on DoneDeal.', 'With the supply constraints on new electric vehicles, used EVs will have to account for a large percentage of EV targets over the next decade. The DoneDeal survey found that the most important consideration for buyers when it comes to purchasing a second-hand EV is the upfront purchase cost (number 1 concern for 32% of respondents), followed closely by the range of the vehicle (number 1 concern for 25% of respondents).\r\n\r\nSpeaking about the findings, Fergus Sharkey, Head of Business Supports and Transport, SEAI says:\r\n\r\n“Buying a used EV is a great way to gain all the benefits of driving electric, at a reduced cost. Now with more options available and reasons to drive electric, the used EV market is growing. If you’re thinking about buying electric, the SEAI have advice and information available on our website along with Compare and Calculate online tools to help check potential cost savings. With the number of EVs in Ireland doubling year on year, there has never been a better time to save money and to help change Ireland’s energy use for the better”.\r\n\r\nTop of the list of concerns buyers have around buying a used EV is how many year’s battery life is left (a concern for 83% of respondents). Concerns over the range that a used EV battery can achieve was a consideration for 78% of respondents. The psychological phenomenon of “range anxiety” remains a persistent hurdle for Irish consumers, and improving our charging infrastructure will be paramount in the further adoption of EVs in this country. There are currently only 1,350 EV charging points on the island of Ireland, operated and maintained by the ESB. In contrast, Norway currently has a staggering 17,000 charging stations across the country to accommodate their population of just over 5.5 million. The Government’s plan to roll-out a pool of high-powered chargers every 60 km on our motorway network will certainly help remove some of the anxiety around range.\r\n\r\nPositive signals remain for the EV market in 2023 with 70% of Irish car buyers considering an EV as their next purchase. However, DoneDeal’s consumer findings also show that the adoption of EVs in Ireland doesn’t come without concerns for motorists. With updates to the Climate Action Plan aiming to ensure that nearly one in three private cars will be an electric vehicle by 2030, allaying these concerns and building a strong second hard EV market will be key to achieving this target.', '14:05:51', '4 mins', 1),
